  "body": "# The Astive Toolkit Project \r\n\r\nAstive Toolkit (ATK) was designed to overcome the complexity of building custom voice applications on Asterisk PBX. ATK, uses Asterisk's AGI and AMI to create powerful interactive menus with Java. Most of the ATK functionalities can be replaced to allow third-parties implementations or services.\r\n\r\nATK makes creating voice applications easier for developers, however, it is important to have a good Asterisk foundation. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Java 1.7+\r\n* Maven 3.x.x+\r\n* Asterisk 1.8+\r\n* Git (optional)\r\n\r\n## Getting Astive\r\n\r\nTo download and build ATK perform the following steps in your console:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/fonoster/astivetoolkit.git\r\ncd astivetoolkit\r\n./assembly\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: The script will generate the Astive Server and the SDK. You can find the assemblies in folder 'dist'.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started With Astive\r\n\r\nA good way to start building apps with Astive is by reading the [wiki](https://github.com/fonoster/astivetoolkit/wiki/GuideHelloWorldTutorial). There you will find detail information in how to build, test, and deploy your apps.\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\nThe best way to get help is through the [Google Groups](http://bit.ly/13KGLyx).
