## Getting Astive

A pre-assembled version of ATK can be found in [the website](http://astivetoolkit.org/downloads). You can also build ATK as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psanders/astivetoolkit.git
cd astivetoolkit
./assembly
```

The script will generate the Astive Server and the SDK. You can find the assemblies in folder 'dist'.

## Example

A simple application:

```java
public class App extends Astivlet {
    @Override
    public void service(AstivletRequest request, AstivletResponse response) {
        try {
            response.answer();
            response.streamFile("tt-monkeys");
            response.hangup();
        } catch (AgiException ex) {
            out.print(ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
